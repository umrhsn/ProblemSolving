Great question! Let’s break down why isPalindromeBestPerformance

is the fastest among the three solutions

in your code.

---

1. No Regular Expressions or String Allocations

No replaceAll

or toLowerCase

:

Unlike the first solution, it does not use replaceAll

(which uses regex and creates a new string) or toLowerCase

(which also creates a new string).

No new string creation

:

It works directly on the original character array, avoiding any extra memory allocation.

---

2. Direct Character Array Access

Works on char[]

:

By converting the string to a character array (char[] str = s.toCharArray();

), it accesses characters directly, which is slightly faster than repeated charAt()

calls on a string.

---

3. Manual Character Checks (No Library Calls)

No Character

class methods

:

Instead of calling Character.isLetterOrDigit()

or Character.toLowerCase()

, it uses direct ASCII value comparisons.

This avoids the overhead of method calls and locale checks that Java’s Character

methods perform.

Manual case-insensitive comparison

:

For letters, it normalizes both to a 0-based index (str[i] - 'A'

or str[i] - 'a'

) and compares those, which is faster than converting to lower/upper case.

---

4. Optimized Logic for Digits and Letters

Digits are compared directly

:

If both are digits, it compares them as-is.

If only one is a digit, returns false immediately

:

This avoids unnecessary checks.

Letters are compared case-insensitively using arithmetic

:

No need for conversion functions.

---

5. Single Pass, Constant Space

Single while loop

:

Only one pass through the string, skipping non-alphanumeric characters on the fly.

Constant extra space

:

Only uses a few integer variables and the character array.

In Short

isPalindromeBestPerformance

is the fastest because:

It avoids all expensive operations (regex, string allocation, library calls).

It uses direct, low-level character comparisons.

It processes the string in a single pass with minimal overhead.

This is as close to optimal as you can get in Java for this problem!

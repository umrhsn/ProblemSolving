The **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** is a clever and efficient way to find the majority element in an array (
the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times), using **O(n) time** and **O(1) space**.

---

## **How It Works**

The algorithm maintains:

- A **candidate** for the majority element.
- A **count** representing the candidate's "vote balance".

It works in a single pass:

1. **Initialize** `count = 0` and `candidate` to any value.
2. **Iterate** through the array:
    - If `count == 0`, set `candidate = current element`.
    - If `current element == candidate`, increment `count`.
    - Else, decrement `count`.
3. **Return** the candidate.

---

## **Why Does This Work?**

- Every time you see the candidate, you "vote" for it.
- Every time you see a different number, you "vote against" the candidate.
- If the candidate's count drops to zero, you pick the next number as a new candidate.
- Since the majority element appears more than half the time, it will always survive as the final candidate.

## **Example**

Suppose `nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

| Step | Current | Candidate | Count |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1    | 2       | 2         | 1     |
| 2    | 2       | 2         | 2     |
| 3    | 1       | 2         | 1     |
| 4    | 1       | 2         | 0     | ← count is zero, next element becomes candidate
| 5    | 1       | 1         | 1     |
| 6    | 2       | 1         | 0     | ← count is zero, next element becomes candidate
| 7    | 2       | 2         | 1     |

Final candidate is **2**, which is the majority element.

## **Code (from your file)**

```java
public static int majorityElementBoyerMoore(int[] nums) {
    int count = 0;
    int candidate = nums[0];
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (count == 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }
        count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }
    return candidate;
}
```

## **Summary**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Guarantee:** Works when a majority element is guaranteed to exist.

**It's one of the most elegant algorithms for this problem!**
